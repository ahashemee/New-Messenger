# **Messenger**

###### Messenger is an iPhone only application, currently capable of running on ios 13.5 and is in its beta stages.

### Motivation

##### As a high school student who has been programming for a couple years, I felt that the the best method to enhance my learning in Computer Coding 2 would be to throw myself at a project I have no experience in. I was and still am not 100% familiar with XCode nor Swift, I'm still learning as I go and honestly, it's tough. The struggle of restarting my program multiple times frustrates me, but it motivates me twice as much. Learning about programming is something I will never get bored of.

### Technologies Used

###### This project is coded 100% in Swift, as you can see from my repo. I used the XCode software, which, if you're not familiar, is Apple's integrated development environment for macOS, which can be used to develop software for all Apple products.


## References

##### As much as I would like to say I learned Swift and how to use XCode on my own, I must say that I learned a lot from a guy called [iOS Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnksRRifsSCGUZpQukUKAyg "iOS Academy's YouTube Account") on YouTube. His tutorials thuroughly assisted me in this journey and without him, I would not be where I am in my code.

## Deliverable 5.

#### Reflection Questions
1.The goal was to complete lessons 14-16. 
2. I did not meet this goal because while I was focusing on my AP Physics assessment earlier this week, I cleared my trash from my mac which happened to have my ViewModels and Models folder. This means almost half my project cannot be run or completed.
3. Well, like I’ve said every time before this “I’m going to put more time in”. Unfortunately, that’s not enough, I’m completely restarting my code, creating a new repository and doing it correct this time. 
4. Unfortunately, there are no features that are new.

## Deliverable 4.

#### Reflection Questions
1. The goal was to complete lessons 10-13.
2. I did not, my file was corrupted and I have to restart from my last commit.
3. I’m really falling behind in other classes and I have a couple AP tests coming up so I’m not sure if I will be able to commit more time to this than I already am. During the following long weekends I have to catch up/
4. Right now there are no features that are new.

## Deliverable 3.

#### YouTube Link

Here is the [link](https://youtu.be/soYuD5fZYYE) to my YouTube video demonstrating all of my features.

#### Reflection Questions

1. In my learning plan, the deliverable was to be able to copmlete all courses to 10, including 10. 
2. I did meet this goal.
4. I don't think there needs to be a change in anything. I am currently at a cruising pace to finish this project on time.

## Deliverable 2

So far I have learned all the basics of Swift through the Codecademy swift course. The following are the ideas I have learned: Variables, Conditionals and Logic, Loops,
Arrays and Sets, Dictionaries, Functions, and Structures. These are the basics I have learned from Codecademy. I have also learned the process of creating an XCode file
and create a repository from said file. Unfortunately I have no source code from my actual project. However, from this URL: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKgfdE_9X_Q&ab_channel=AmaanHashemee. You can see what I've learned so far.
