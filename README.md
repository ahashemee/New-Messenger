#### YouTube Link

Here is the [link](https://youtu.be/soYuD5fZYYE) to my YouTube video demonstrating all of my features.

#### Reflection Questions

1. In my learning plan, the deliverable was to be able to copmlete all courses to 10, including 10. 
2. I did meet this goal.
4. I don't think there needs to be a change in anything. I am currently at a cruising pace to finish this project on time.

## Deliverable 2

So far I have learned all the basics of Swift through the Codecademy swift course. THe following are the ideas I have learned: Variables, Conditionals and Logic, Loops,
Arrays and Sets, Dictionaries, Functions, and Structures. These are the basics I have learned from Codecademy. I have also learned the process of creating an XCode file
and create a repository from said file. Unfortunately I have no source code from my actual project. However, from this URL: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKgfdE_9X_Q&ab_channel=AmaanHashemee. You can see what I've learned so far.
